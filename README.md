# Scenario modelling of policy interventions regarding data sharing for RRI and Open Science transition

This repository contains the code for the DASH model, developed within the [ON-MERRIT project](https://on-merrit.eu) and introduced in D6.2 _Scenario modelling of policy interventions regarding data sharing for RRI and Open Science transition_.

## Directories and files
The model itself is contained in the file `data_sharing.nlogo`. The model was developed and run with Netlogo 6.2.0 on Windows. All code required to reproduce the figures is contained in the directory `analysis`. The analysis is reproducible thanks to the [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) R package. The data is not hosted on GitHub for reasons of size, but will be added to the Zenodo release.
